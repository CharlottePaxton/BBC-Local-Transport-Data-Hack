# Welcome to the first BBC local transport hack day, 28 June, BBC Mailbox, Birmingham

## Purpose  
To give the regional journalists on secondment with the BBC Shared Data Unit the opportunity to learn about the data sources and challenges that might inspire story ideas in local transport

To enable transport specialists to learn about transport data platforms and data sources, and understand the purpose and capabilities of the BBC Shared Data Unit

Attendees include:
* seconded regional journalists 
* BBC Shared Data Unit staff 
* BBC Visual Journalism team
* transport data platform providers and technical support
* transport planners and modellers
* public authority transport staff
* transport policy and data experts 

## Big picture challenges to tackle
**Policy**: better data and modelling tools to more accurately and sensitively choose locations for housing/development/transport hubs etc.   
**Operational**: reducing congestion by sharing data and coordinating construction /disruption projects to minimise impact.  For journalists, holding large organisations (HS2, Highways England, Network Rail etc) to account for not doing all they can in this.  
**Changing how people see and use transport**: 
The choices and information available on different ways to travel, incentivised use of public transport to reduce car use, understanding the different modes of transport people choose, and the shift in this over time
